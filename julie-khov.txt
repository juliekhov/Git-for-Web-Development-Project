 A: A parent child selector creates inheritance meaning that element will inherit the changes made on the parent element. For example, whatever is nested inside a parent element will also receive those same selector effects / changes. However, some css effects will change and others do not.
A html selector or body selector can act as parent elements on the page and then its child elements may inherit those properties.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
A: The difference between an inline element and a block element is that
inline elements don't start on a new line, they appear on the same line as the content and tags beside them. Some examples of inline elements are <span> , <strong>, and <img> tags. When it comes to margins and padding, browsers treat inline elements differently.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
You can use the box model and manipulate the width.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default.
Examples of block-level elements:

<div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>

Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>

Examples of inline-block elements:
<button>
<input>
<select>
<textarea>


    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
A: The box-model relies on the margins and padding to set the width of the content.

 While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independently research the following topics to learn more about Git.

 Research and understand what a merge conflict is and how to resolve it.
A: Receive Git Bash Error:

error: Entry '<fileName>' not uptodate. Cannot merge. (Changes in working directory)
Git fails during the merge
A failure DURING a merge indicates a conflict between the current local branch and the branch being merged. This indicates a conflict with another developers code.

Resolve merge conflict:

Use git status (checks current directory)
The output from git status indicates that there are unmerged paths due to a conflict. The merge.text file now appears in a modified state. We can examine the modifications. The most direct way to resolve a merge conflict is to edit the conflicted file. 

then use:

use git add <filename>
git commit -m "merged and resolved the conflict in filename.extension"
git log (produce a log with a list of commits that conflict between the merging branches)
git diff (helps find differences between states of a repository/files)


 Research the Git commands pull, rebase, merge. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the main branch.

pull (you can use the git pull command to automatically fetch and then merge that
remote branch into your current branch)
rebase (With the rebase command, you can take all the changes that were committed on one branch and replay them on a different branch)
merge (merge two branches together, combines files together)

In Git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another: merge and the rebase. 

 Research the Git commands reset , revert, clean. These commands will allow you to go back and amends previous commits you have made.

The first thing reset will do is move what HEAD points to. This isn’t the same as changing HEAD
itself (which is what checkout does); reset moves the branch that HEAD is pointing to.

Git gives you the option of
making a new commit which undoes all the changes from an existing one. Git calls this operation a
“revert”, and in this particular scenario

 Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console.

Its an interface that uses color and buttons and graphics to make the git console more pretty and options for commiting repositories.
You could use SourceTree or Github as GUI interfaces.

 Research and setup SSH keys with GitHub, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.
